## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to implement both email/password and OAuth authentication
- Securely managing sessions with cookies and JWT
- Building modular REST APIs with Express
- Designing and translating Figma UI into code with Tailwind
- Balancing user experience with security best practices
- I’m proud of how I built a flexible button component using variants – making the UI consistent and maintainable with just one reusable CTA button across the app.
